Gosh I love this pie. I'm pretty sure it started with dad's mom, Trini. My dad then invented his own version of it, and later I invented mine. It's kind of become a thing in our family to have your own version of this pie. On the surface, it's a basic recipe, but it really lends itself to riffing and customization. Have fun!

# The Actual Recipe #

## Setup & Prep ##

For each pie, I use:

- About 4, **Granny Smith apples**, sometimes more
- At most 1¼ cups of **granulated sugar**
- Over 2 cups of **flour**
- At most 1¼ teaspoons of **ground cinnamon**
- A little bit of **ground nutmeg**
- Slightly more than ½ teaspoon of **salt** (I usually use iodized)
- About 1 Tablespoon of **lemon juice** (either just-squeezed or pre-squeezed)
- 3 Tablespoons of **shortening** (lower crust only)
- 2 Tablespoons of **butter** (lower crust only)
- 4 Tablespoons of **cold water** (lower crust only)
{:.ingredients}

I use one **large mixing bowl** for the filling, and a **medium mixing bowl** for the top crust, and another **medium mixing bowl** for the bottom crust. I also often just use store-bought bottom crust (the kind you unroll, not the kind that's already in a pie pan), so that third bowl isn't strictly necessary.

I always use my own **pie pan**/dish, though I lost them in a move recently, so I learned **a cake pan will also do**.

I pre-heat the oven to **400ºF** (204ºC), but if it finishes pre-heating early (as I find it often does), I'll turn that down to ~200ºF (93ºC) until I'm about done assembling the pie



## Mix & Roll ##

First, I **peel, core, and slice** apples until I have **4 cups of apple slices**. I prefer very thin slices (about the same size as two quarters [two 1€ coins] stacked on top of each other), but my dad likes large slices, like you'd give to a child for lunch.

I place all these into the large bowl
